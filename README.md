**Predictive Maintenance for Electric Vehicle Fleets**

FleetIQ is a data-driven predictive maintenance solution for EV fleets that replaces fixed interval servicing with machine learning based health forecasting.

## 🔍 Project Overview
FleetIQ predicts:
- **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** – *when maintenance is needed*
- **Component Health Score (CHS)** – *why and where degradation occurs*

The system enables proactive maintenance, reduces downtime and optimizes costs.
